            <p class="has-dropcap">The Sanctuary of Eleusis was one of the most famous in the ancient world. Its occult rites, known as the Eleusinian Mysteries, literally gave us the world "mysterious." On the borders of Athens, some fourteen miles distant, stood the shrine to The Two Goddesses, Demeter and Kore (Persephone). The illustrious Eleusinian Mysteries attracted thousands of initiates every year including Athenians of all kinds, tourists and visitors, Greeks, Romans, and even several Roman Emperors.</p>

            <p><i>At this very spot</i>, the Athenians believed, Hades sprung from the underworld and snatched Persephone. More proudly, they boasted, it was this same spot where Demeter gave the gift of grain to humankind. The rites included several days of purification, sacrifice, and long marching and dancing into the night. We know very little because of the vow to keep all knowledge of them from any non-initiates. These initiates <em>(mystai)</em> are the source of our word "mystery."</p>

            <p>At this heavily visited and visible spot, for centuries, the Athenians published inscriptions in honor of individuals and gods. In the Roman era, however, they erected statues at unprecedented rates. These inscriptions, both in their individuality and in sum, provide evidence on hundreds of individuals and the workings of important institutions.</p>

              <strong>Note:</strong> this website was primarily intended to aid researchers in the field of Roman Athens, and so does not contain extensive explanatory background aimed at non-specialists. For that reason and others, no translations for the inscriptions are available at this time. For an excellent starting point and commentary on the individuals and inscriptions discussed herein, see Clinton, Kevin. <u>The Inscriptions on Stone: Documents of the Sanctuary of the Two Goddesses and Public Documents of the Deme</u>, 3 Vols.

            <p>As time went on, not only were there more inscriptions, people, and honors, but these claims became more interwoven and people linked themselves to more distant relatives and statuses. Tracking or visualizing the interconnectedness of all this is nearly impossible traditionally. This site offers tools for scholars to examine the individuals, institutions, and honors used Eleusis as a canvas to project their claims and reshape Athenian history.</p>

            <p>An example of the difficulty can be seen in an inscription publicly funded by Athens at Eleusis during the reign of Marcus Aurelius in honor of an extraordinary altar-priest of the sanctuary, Lucius Memmius from the deme of Thorikos. The statue is lost, but the statue base reads…</p>

          The personal boasts of Memmius reveal much about the values of the Athenian elite under the Roman empire. He was able to claim honors both civic and imperial, Athenian and Roman. Many of the offices that he advertised were public, yet his tenure of the altar-priesthood was private, obtained through his membership in the priestly college of the Kerykes. In proclaiming his descent from daduchs, the most important sacred officials of the Kerykes, and archons, the most important public offices of Athens, Memmius neatly merges civic and sacred elements. The site of Eleusis, and the activities of members of the Kerykes in particular, demonstrate that there was an informal but important connection between political and religious authority. Furthermore, ‘public’ and ‘private’ forms authority were not opposed, but regularly combined for mutual benefit. Similarly, Athenian and Roman identities were not necessarily at odds. Not only was Memmius an altar-priest at the Sanctuary of Eleusis, but he was also an imperial priest who initiated members of the emperor's family. In an attempt to cement their place in the competitive game of status display, elites regularly resorted to both Athenian and Roman honors. Roman honors supplemented, but never surpassed native Athenian status. In combining these elements they constructed a positive understanding of Athens’ place in the Roman empire.

          This project also explores a new possibility for understanding long-term trends by employing dynamic network analysis to visually map changes in the complex combinations of statuses and the reciprocal connections between individuals and institutions recorded on stone. Inscriptions are not merely passive records but also persuasive documents, selectively foregrounding some social realities while eliding others. Tracing these constellations of associations, we can put our finger on the pulse of social competition and status display and understand precisely why 'Romanization' is a difficult term to explain change at the sanctuary.

        This website centers around 'Networks' (dicussed below), and the four main kinds of entities appearing at Eleusis (1) the inscriptions themselves (2) the institutions appearing on the inscriptions (3) the people appearing on the inscriptions and (4) the honors displayed by the institutions and people on the inscriptions. To navigate any of these four types, choose the corresponding entry from the navigation menu on the top right of the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        This will take you to a general table to browse and search all corresponding entities. Note: if you are viewing this site on mobile, your experience in streamlined and you do not have access to search features. Above each field in the table you will find search fields where you can enter any criteria you desire. You will also find a drop-down menu indicated by downward caret (v) that lets you sort columns either ascending, descending, or hide the column all together if you wish. At the very bottom of the page you can find buttons to page forward and backward through the data, as well as change the number of items displayed on a single page.

      <p>
        Once you click on any given entry, be it an inscription, person, et c. you will be taken to the individual item's page. In the individual view, there are three compnents split into two frames. On the left side frame you will find the first two components (1) any information and metadata relating to the individual entry you selected and below that (2) drop-down lists of information and links to any related entries. For example, if you are viewing an inscriptions, this includes people who appeared on the inscription among other things. If you click on any related entry, you will immediately be taken to the corresponding page. On the right side frame, you will find a network graph. Slightly different than the true 'Network' section, this is just another handy way of viewing all relateded entities. Much like the lists, you can click on any item in the network graph and be taken to the correct page. Note: if you are viewing this site on mobile, again your experience is streamlined here, and you won't have access the network graph.

      <p>
        Much of the core of my reseach, however, is about connectivity. And to view large scale trends and the connections that flow indirectly between people, inscriptions, and the claims they make, we need network graphs. This site contains different network graphs emphasizing the connections that bind people displayed in stone. The sanctuary is full of inscriptions and statues bought and paid for by one individual (or institution) in honor of another individual. Individually, these seem like one-offs, but viewed in sum they demonstrate an immense network of reciprocity that bound the elites of Roman Athens together. In these graphs, individuals (or institutions) appear connected through some kind of interaction recorded on the stone. The more interactions, the more tightly they are bound.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, there are three different graphs. (1) Benefaction: Sponsors and Honors - Tracks the most direct and meaningful connections. The only people are institutions in this graph are those that either sponsored and inscription or had an inscription sponsored in honor of them. Thus, a link in this charge reflects not only a claimed social link, but a direct financial connection as well. (2) Sponsors and Those on Their Inscriptions - This chart casts a wider net for connections, but connections that may be more lose and indirect. In this chart connections are drawn between those who paid for inscriptions and everyone who appeared on the inscription (even if not an honorand). (3) Entities Coappearing in Inscriptions - The widest and loosest net, but one that tracks patterns of social associations over time. This chart links together anyone (or institution) who appears on the same inscription together. As with the other network graphs, every item is clickable and will take you to its corresponding individual page, so use this to explore!
